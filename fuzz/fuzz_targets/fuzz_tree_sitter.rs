//! A fuzzer for the Tree-sitter grammar.
//!
//! This fuzzer runs the same input through both the Tree-sitter parser and
//! RCL's parser, and then checks that they agree. Right now we only check
//! that they agree about the input validity, but we should do a deep comparison
//! of the parse tree. TODO: Implement that comparison.
