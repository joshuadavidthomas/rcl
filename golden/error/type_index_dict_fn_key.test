Error: Type mismatch. Expected a value that fits this type:

  (x: Any) -> Int

But got this value:

  {
    empty_set = std.empty_set,
    range = std.range,
    read_file_utf8 = std.read_file_utf8,
  }

stdin:1:9
  ╷
1 │ let f = x => 0;
  ╵         ^~~~~~
Note: Expected Function because of this value.
